Name of Project: Pickup / Training app (might change name later)

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
- This project is meant for basketball players to be able to connect with each other to either train together or get a squad together for pickup basketball. Users will be able to login and input their information and filter search and match with other users with similar skills / level / time / location. From there users can contact each other via email or if I'm able to integrate a messenger chat function in the website itself. If possilbe the app will also display a map of where users prefered location of playing is at.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- Allow users to create account / profile
- Users can add their basketball details (skill, level, time, location, checkbox for training or pickup?)
- Users can see other users details based on whichever filter the select

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- React Frontend
- C# backened 
- MySQL

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- Messenger chat function for users to directly contact each other with
- Integrated map showing location of each users prefrence of gym location maybe using googles map api or openlayers seems like a good 2nd choice. If these don't work there is a list of potential apis I could use.
- Host on firebase 

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- ASP.NET core MVC
- MySQL workbench
- JavaScript
- firebase
- map api (google, openlayers, tomtom, mapbox, HERE, mapfit) might pivot from google because it's not free and the other ones seem to function the same way i'd want it to

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
- Hopefully this project isn't beyond my capabilities
