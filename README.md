# _Capstone_

#### By _**Jeff Lai**_

#### _This applications will allow users to connect with other users to either train together or gather a team for basketball. Users will be able to input their skill level, location, and time preferences._

## Technologies Used

* _React_
* _Firebase_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your desktop._
* _Navigate to the top level of directory._
* _Open index.html in your browser._

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
